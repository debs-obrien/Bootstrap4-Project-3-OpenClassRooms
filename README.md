#Bootstrap Project 3 - Film-Festival

Create a website to promote the 2017 Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival held between the 5th and 8th of August at Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York which can hold up to 5,000 people. The event should show that films can appeal to audiences of all ages. The website will display information about the festival, the films that will be shown and regularly published news or announcements about the festival. Links will be added to the city of Brooklyn’s news website and the Brooklyn Bridge Park’s website as well as social media links to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. A pre-register form will be added so that people can register for the free event so as to be able to close registration once capacity reaches 5,000 people. 

##Technologies Used:
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4
